2025-10-22 Emma Krvaric  <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Met with group and determined my own personal workplan.

	* Approved workplan.md stating that I would be responsible for Analysis 2
	* Created my own notes to determine my own workflow

2025-10-23 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Group meeting #2, actually started work on Analysis 2.

	* Chose the data I wanted to analyze (Uppsala)
	* Cleaned the data using Ossian and Hugo's code

2025-10-24 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Created first rough draft of Analysis2.cxx and Analysis2.h

	* Created both files and drafted out my steps in comments
	* Completed header file, source is still a work in progress.

2025-10-25 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Finished Analysis2.cxx partially

	* Most important part was getting everything on the page first.
	* Editing will come later (though I spent several hours on this so far)

2025-10-26 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Did a final look-over Analysis2.cxx

	* Hopefully finished everything (not including main.cxx or my latex report)
	* Compiled it to test if it works ()
	* Altered visual aesthetics of histogram to personalize it and improve legibility
	* realized i used absolute paths by mistake for testing, altered it to pass through main.cxx
