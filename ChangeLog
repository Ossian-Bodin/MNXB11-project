# ChangeLog

2025-10-31 Axel Cerne <ax4888ce-s@student.lu.se>

	Commits on Oct 26, 2025: 
		Added a separate dataset ice_cream.csv
	Commits on Oct 27, 2025: 
		Wrote a reader function for ice_cream.csv
			* reader stores comma-separated cols in std::vectors in a struct IceCreamData
		Removed .csv file from git (local only)
		Wrote my own reader for SMHI datasets to extract bara-data into struct TemperatureData
			* Wrote computeMonthlyTemp() to average temp readings over month so that temp monthly corresp to ice_cream (months)
	Commits on Oct 29, 2025:
		Implemented plot function() for datasets
			* first a plotTempOnly() to see if it works, and to learn ROOT
			* finally a plotTempVsSales() to plot both in the same canvas
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Refactored computeMonthlyTemp() and plotTempVsSales() to align with repo workflow, using the existing Measurement class and read_measurements() instead of my separate temperature reader
			* i.e., passing std::vector\<Measurement\> instead of std::string filename to my functions
		Implemented gPad to plot on a double axis
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Buggfixing alignment issues between ice_cream months and temp months
		(still not 100% satisfied)

2025-10-31
* Added changelog updates

2025-10-30
* Finalized the creation of void function  tempReader 

2025-10-29
* Fixed compilation issue with g++ by adding an exception for error codes in DataExtraction.cxx

2025-10-23
* Added the first iteration of a function tempReader which reads the TTree created from the persist_measurement function and returns a histogram with the mean temperatures each year for a dataset.

2025-10-22
* Created a class called Measurement which can store the measurements from the datafiles, along with Get-functions to access them. Created two functions. One called read_measurements for filling a vector of the object type Measurement with all data from the datafiles. The other function, persist_measurements, takes the vector of object type Measurement and creates a TTree with branches filled with data, which can later be used in analysis.

	Consecutive days analysis plotting

	* Added a function that plots number of consecutive days in ROOT

2025-10-29

	Consecutive days analysis

	* Created the basic structure of the consecutive days analysis

2025-10-26

	Makefile, README changes and clean_data function

	* Created a basic makefile that links to required libraries
	* Added instructions on how to install the CLI parser argumentum in the README

2025-10-22

	Data extraction/reading and CLI interface

	* Merged data extraction and reading functionality from Hugo Henriksson
	* Fixed syntax errors in the above mentioned code
	* Added CLI parser functionality to the main file

	Commits on Oct 29, 2025:
		*Implemented function that plots the highest and lowest temperature of each year

	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:

2025-10-22 Emma Krvaric  <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Met with group and determined my own personal workplan.

	* Approved workplan.md stating that I would be responsible for Analysis 2
	* Created my own notes to determine my own workflow

2025-10-23 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Group meeting #2, actually started work on Analysis 2.

	* Chose the data I wanted to analyze (Uppsala)
	* Cleaned the data using Ossian's and Hugo's code

2025-10-24 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Created first rough draft of Analysis2.cxx and Analysis2.h

	* Created both files and drafted out my steps in comments
	* Full disclosure: I asked ChatGPT for what the steps will look like, as I was completely lost. These steps are listed as numbered notes in my .cxx. and I referred to the github demo for extra help.
	* Completed header file, but my source is still a work in progress.

2025-10-25 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Finished Analysis2.cxx partially

	* Most important part was getting everything on the page first, this is a draft.
	* I asked Chat GPT to look over my code because I was not sure if what i wrote was accurate for my end goal
	* Editing will come later, spent several hours on this so far. Tabled for next day.

2025-10-26 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Look-over Analysis2.cxx

	* Hopefully finished everything (not including main.cxx link or my latex report)
	* Compiled it to test if it works (it does)
	* Customized my histogram
	* Had to fix paths?

2025-10-30 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Final edits before turn-in!

	* Renamed almost all variables for clarity for outside readers?
	* Changed my output file to update instead of recreate for 1 neat group file
	* Started my portion of the report in overleaf
	* Tried to make my code less clunky? I think it is still really inefficient but i dont know what i would change
	* Decided to keep all of my notes, might delete once report is finished, but they reflect my thought process
