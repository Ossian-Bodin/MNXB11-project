2025-10-22 Emma Krvaric  <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Met with group and determined my own personal workplan.

	* Approved workplan.md stating that I would be responsible for Analysis 2
	* Created my own notes to determine my own workflow

2025-10-23 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Group meeting #2, actually started work on Analysis 2.

	* Chose the data I wanted to analyze (Uppsala)
	* Cleaned the data using Ossian's and Hugo's code

2025-10-24 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Created first rough draft of Analysis2.cxx and Analysis2.h

	* Created both files and drafted out my steps in comments
	* Full disclosure: I asked ChatGPT for what the steps will look like, as I was completely lost. These steps are listed as numbered notes in my .cxx. and I referred to the github demo for extra help.
	* Completed header file, but my source is still a work in progress.

2025-10-25 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Finished Analysis2.cxx partially

	* Most important part was getting everything on the page first, this is a draft.
	* I asked Chat GPT to look over my code because I was not sure if what i wrote was accurate for my end goal
	* Editing will come later, spent several hours on this so far. Tabled for next day.

2025-10-26 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Look-over Analysis2.cxx

	* Hopefully finished everything (not including main.cxx link or my latex report)
	* Compiled it to test if it works (it does)
	* Customized my histogram
	* Had to fix paths?

2025-10-30 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Final edits before turn-in!

	* Renamed almost all variables for clarity for outside readers?
	* Changed my output file to update instead of recreate for 1 neat group file
	* Started my portion of the report in overleaf
	* Tried to make my code less clunky? I think it is still really inefficient but i dont know what i would change
	* Decided to keep all of my notes, might delete once report is finished, but they reflect my thought process
