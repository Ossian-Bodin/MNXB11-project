2025-10-22 Emma Krvaric  <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Met with group and determined my own personal workplan.

	* Approved workplan.md stating that I would be responsible for Analysis 2
	* Created my own notes to determine my own workflow

2025-10-23 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Group meeting #2, actually started work on Analysis 2.

	* Chose the data I wanted to analyze (Uppsala)
	* Cleaned the data using Ossian's and Hugo's code

2025-10-24 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Created first rough draft of Analysis2.cxx and Analysis2.h

	* Created both files and drafted out my steps in comments
	* Full disclosure: I asked ChatGPT for what the steps will look like, as I was completely lost. These steps are listed as numbered notes in my .cxx. and I referred to the github demo for extra help.
	* Completed header file, but my source is still a work in progress.

2025-10-25 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Finished Analysis2.cxx partially

	* Most important part was getting everything on the page first, this is a draft essentially.
	* I asked Chat GPT to look over my code because I was not sure if wrote the code to show me what I want
	* Editing will come later (though I spent several hours on this so far ahhhhhhgg!!!)

2025-10-26 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Did a final look-over Analysis2.cxx

	* Hopefully finished everything (not including main.cxx or my latex report)
	* Compiled it to test if it works (it does)
	* Altered visual aesthetics of histogram to personalize it
	* realized i used absolute paths by mistake for testing, had to fix it

2025-10-29 Emma Krvaric <emma.krvaric.1546@student.lu.se>

	Asked teammates to look over my histogram code and began LATEX report

	* Histogram wasnt doing want I wanted when I printed out the graph, I played with it to see if I could fix it.
	* I began my .tex report for Analysis2, with help from my group, I am not familiar with Latex...
