	Commits on Oct 26, 2025: 
		Added a separate dataset ice_cream.csv
	Commits on Oct 27, 2025: 
		Wrote a reader function for ice_cream.csv
			* reader stores comma-separated cols in std::vectors in a struct IceCreamData
		Removed .csv file from git (local only)
		Wrote my own reader for SMHI datasets to extract bara-data into struct TemperatureData
			* Wrote computeMonthlyTemp() to average temp readings over month so that temp monthly corresp to ice_cream (months)
	Commits on Oct 29, 2025:
		Implemented plot function() for datasets
			* first a plotTempOnly() to see if it works, and to learn ROOT
			* finally a plotTempVsSales() to plot both in the same canvas
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Refactored computeMonthlyTemp() and plotTempVsSales() to align with repo workflow, using the existing Measurement class and read_measurements() instead of my separate temperature reader
			* i.e., passing std::vector\<Measurement\> instead of std::string filename to my functions
		Implemented gPad to plot on a double axis
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Buggfixing alignment issues between ice_cream months and temp months
		(still not 100% satisfied)

2025-10-31
* Added changelog updates

2025-10-30
* Finalized the creation of void function  tempReader 

2025-10-29
* Fixed compilation issue with g++ by adding an exception for error codes in DataExtraction.cxx

2025-10-23
* Added the first iteration of a function tempReader which reads the TTree created from the persist_measurement function and returns a histogram with the mean temperatures each year for a dataset.

2025-10-22
* Created a class called Measurement which can store the measurements from the datafiles, along with Get-functions to access them. Created two functions. One called read_measurements for filling a vector of the object type Measurement with all data from the datafiles. The other function, persist_measurements, takes the vector of object type Measurement and creates a TTree with branches filled with data, which can later be used in analysis.
